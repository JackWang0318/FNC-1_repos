# FNC-1 Task  
For detailed infomation, see [FakeNewsChallengeOrg](http://www.fakenewschallenge.org/) 
Identified the stance of a given news article body with respect to a given headline, then classified whether the article body agrees, disagrees, discusses the topic of the headline, or is unrelated to it.

## The goal of FNC
is to explore how artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem. We believe that these AI technologies hold promise for significantly automating parts of the procedure human fact checkers use today to determine if a story is real or a hoax.

## Input
A headline and a body text - either from the same news article or from two different articles.

## Output
Classify the stance of the body text relative to the claim made in the headline into one of four categories:
Agrees: The body text agrees with the headline.
Disagrees: The body text disagrees with the headline.
Discusses: The body text discuss the same topic as the headline, but does not take a position
Unrelated: The body text discusses a different topic than the headline
